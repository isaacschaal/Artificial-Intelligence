        "I'll first explain why the second heuristic function dominates the other two. It is already given that the Manhattan distance dominates missing tiles, so I just have to show this dominates the Manhattan distance. The second heuristic functions is Manhattan Distance +( Linear Conflits x2), because this is the minimum number of moves that must happen, as we both must habe the tiles move back to there original spot (the manhattan distance), and tiles must move out of the way of others and back again (the linear conflicts). Thus, the heuristic is always greater for H2 than H1.\n",

        "The above cell tested the memoization of our basic heuristic functions. It runs each test 5 times and averages them. It first runs the normal heuristic, than the memoized version with an empty dictionary, then the memoized version with a full dic (its empty the first time but full after). We can see that speed implications of the memoization. Across the board, running the memoized version with an empty dictionary increases the running time, which makes sense as there is lots of additonal writing. However once we have a full dictionary with the heuristic outputs, we get a faster running time. This makes sense and shows the benfit of our memoization. It could be improved even more by running it with many different intial states to get an even larger memo_dic and then running it on a novel state."
